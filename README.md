This is a game where you as a turtle have to move across the screen to the other side while avoiding being hit by the "cars" coming across the screen.
I used classes in this program to create all the elements using the Turtle class
You press the up arrow to move the turtle forward and avoid all the cars as you make your way across the screen.
Once you hit the other side the movement of the cars increases, your score increases and your turtle goes back to the start.
